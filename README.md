# My Nix config
its VERY special because it uh does cross platform building (nixos and nix-darwin)  
i have no objections to whoever takes this just buckle up because its REALLY messy  

## todo:

figure out if in nix  
hopefully try and migrate some homebrew packages that SHOULD be in common to commonPackages.nix (couldnt do this because i dont know if AND the nix version doesnt work for some REASON)
